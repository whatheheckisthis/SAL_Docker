Getting Started:

# Lane Detection and Driver Monitoring System Setup

Here’s how you can include the bash commands in a Markdown (`.md`) file, formatted as code blocks:

```markdown
# Lane Detection and Driver Monitoring System Setup

## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/lane-detection-driver-monitoring-aws-lambda-php.git
```

## Navigate into the Project Directory

```bash
cd lane-detection-driver-monitoring-aws-lambda-php
```

## Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build --no-cache -t your-username/lane-detection-php:latest .
```

## Run the Docker Container for Basic Usage

```bash
docker run --name=lane-detection-app -p 80:80 your-username/lane-detection-php:latest
```

## Run with a Custom Configuration for PHP Applications

```bash
docker run --name=lane-detection-app -v /path/to/your/www:/var/www/html -v /path/to/your/etc/apache2:/etc/apache2:ro -v /path/to/your/etc/php:/etc/php:ro -p 80:80 your-username/lane-detection-php:latest
```

## Run as a Docker Service in a Docker Swarm

```bash
docker service create --replicas 2 --name lane-detection-service --publish published=8000,target=80,mode=host --mount type=bind,source=/path/to/your/www,destination=/var/www/html your-username/lane-detection-php:latest
```
```

### Explanation:

- **Code Blocks:** Triple backticks (\`\`\`) are used to format code blocks in Markdown.
- **Bash Syntax Highlighting:** The `bash` keyword immediately after the triple backticks enables syntax highlighting for bash commands.
- **Commands:** Each section provides a specific command or set of commands to execute.

Replace `/path/to/your/www`, `/path/to/your/etc/apache2`, `/path/to/your/etc/php`, and `your-username` with the actual paths and your Docker Hub username or image name.

This Markdown file can be used as documentation to guide users through the setup process.

Certainly! Here’s a Python script that explains the commands and their purpose:

```python
import subprocess

def run_command(command, description):
    """
    Executes a shell command and prints its output along with a description of what the command does.
    
    :param command: The shell command to execute
    :param description: A description of what the command does
    """
    print(f"Executing: {description}")
    print(f"Command: {command}")
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(command, shell=True, check=True, text=True, capture_output=True)
        print(f"Output:\n{result.stdout}")
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error occurred:\n{e.stderr}")
    print("\n")

def main():
    # Description and commands for cloning the repository
    run_command("git clone https://github.com/your-username/lane-detection-driver-monitoring-aws-lambda-php.git",
                "Cloning the repository to your local machine")

    # Description and commands for navigating into the project directory
    run_command("cd lane-detection-driver-monitoring-aws-lambda-php",
                "Navigating into the project directory")

    # Description and commands for building the Docker image
    run_command("docker build --no-cache -t your-username/lane-detection-php:latest .",
                "Building the Docker image for the project")

    # Description and commands for running the Docker container for basic usage
    run_command("docker run --name=lane-detection-app -p 80:80 your-username/lane-detection-php:latest",
                "Running the Docker container for basic usage")

    # Description and commands for running with custom configuration for PHP applications
    run_command("docker run --name=lane-detection-app -v /path/to/your/www:/var/www/html -v /path/to/your/etc/apache2:/etc/apache2:ro -v /path/to/your/etc/php:/etc/php:ro -p 80:80 your-username/lane-detection-php:latest",
                "Running the Docker container with custom configuration for PHP applications")

    # Description and commands for running as a Docker service in a Docker Swarm
    run_command("docker service create --replicas 2 --name lane-detection-service --publish published=8000,target=80,mode=host --mount type=bind,source=/path/to/your/www,destination=/var/www/html your-username/lane-detection-php:latest",
                "Running the Docker container as a service in a Docker Swarm")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:

- **Function `run_command`**: This function executes a given shell command and prints the command's description and output. It also handles any errors that may occur.
- **Function `main`**: Contains the commands to be executed, each with a description of what the command does.
- **Description Argument**: Provides context for each command, making it easier to understand what each command is meant to accomplish.

To use this script, save it as `setup.py` or any preferred name and run it using:

```bash
python setup.py
```

This will execute each command, print the description of what’s happening, and display the output or any errors encountered.
